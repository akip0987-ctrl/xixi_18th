💌 for xixi — my favorite person in the world

hey baby 💖

happy 18th birthday 🕯️🎂✨
eighteen — such a beautiful number, a moment between being young and growing into your own world. i’m so proud of you, truly. i’ve seen how much you’ve grown, how strong you’ve become, and how you always manage to keep that soft heart no matter how heavy the days are. you’re turning 18, but to me, you’ll always be the girl who can make my whole day brighter with just one smile. 🩷

i know we’re far apart right now — and sometimes that distance feels so heavy, like time moves slower whenever i can’t hold you or hear your voice directly. but even in this distance, i still feel you. in the quiet hours of the night, when everything goes silent, i can almost feel your presence — soft, calm, warm. maybe love is like that — it bends space, it stretches time, it stays even when everything else fades.

you know, i keep thinking about how lucky i am. not everyone gets to meet someone who feels like home, and yet, somehow, i met you. you are my kind of peace. you are the sound i want to wake up to, the calm i want to end my days with, the person i want to tell everything to — from stupid little things to my biggest dreams. 💭

i love the way you talk, the way you laugh, the way you care about small things that most people never notice. i love how soft you can be, and yet how brave you are when life gets hard. i love how real you are — even when you’re tired, even when you’re quiet. it makes me want to protect you more, hold you closer, love you deeper.

and yeah… i’m sorry for saying happy birthday too early 😅 i was just too excited — like my heart couldn’t wait to celebrate you. i wanted to be the first one to say it, the first one to remind you how precious you are, how much you matter to me.

you deserve the world, xixi. you deserve mornings full of laughter, nights full of peace, and days filled with warmth. you deserve people who look at you and see light. you deserve someone who never gets tired of reminding you that you are loved — endlessly, quietly, completely.

sometimes i wish i could be there right now — to see the look in your eyes when you blow out the candles, to hear you laugh when someone teases you for growing up too fast, to feel your hand brushing against mine even just for a second. but even if i can’t be there physically, i promise i’m with you in spirit. if you close your eyes, maybe you’ll feel me smiling at you from far away. 🌌

i don’t know what the future will look like, but i know this — i want you in it. i want to see you grow, chase your dreams, fall, stand again, and still smile the way you do. i want to keep being part of your story, even if from a distance, even if quietly, as long as it means i still get to love you.

thank you for being you — for being so genuine, for letting me love you, for trusting me enough to be part of your life. every little thing about you is worth loving, and i mean it.

so here’s to you, baby — to your 18th year, to the dreams you’ll chase, to the moments you’ll live, to the laughter you’ll share. i hope your days are filled with color, your nights with peace, and your heart with warmth.

and whenever things get too much, remember this:
you are never alone.
no matter where i am, a part of me is always with you — loving you, believing in you, wishing you the best in everything you do. 🌷

happy birthday, my love.
i love you endlessly, softly, and truly — today and always. 💞

— me 🕊️💋
